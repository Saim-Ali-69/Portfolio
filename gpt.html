                    <br>
                 <p>Chat GPT is an automated AI chatbot creation system created by Open AI for online customer service. (NLP) is a pre-trained generative chat that uses natural language processing. 
                    <br><br>
                    His data comes from textbooks, websites, and various articles he uses to model his language to respond to human interaction.
                
                    Open AI’s Chat GPT is a highly popular AI-based program that people use for generating dialogues. The chatbot has a language-based model that the developer fine-tunes for human interaction in a conversational manner. 
                    <br><br>
                    Effectively it’s a simulated chatbot primarily designed for customer service; people use it for various other purposes too though. These range from writing essays to drafting business plans, to generating code. But what is it and what can it really do?

<div class="parent-col-3">
    <h1 class="sub-title">What is Chat GPT used for?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The main feature of Chat GPT is generating responses like those humans would provide, in a text box. Therefore, it is suitable for chatbots, AI system conversations, and virtual assistants. 
        <br><br>
        However, it can also give natural answers to questions in a conversational tone and can generate stories poems andm ore. Moreover, Chat GPT can:
        <br><br>
        Write code 
        Write an article or blog post
        Translate
        Debug
        Write a story/poem
        Recommend chords and lyrics
        To make the AI carry out one of these demands, all you need to do is type the command into the chatbot.

    <h1 class="sub-title">What is Chat GPT trained on?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Chat GPT uses natural language processing (NLP). It's a great tool for researchers and developers working on a variety of NLP projects, and there are many specific tasks, domains, and applications you can work with.
        <br><br>
        Well trained on biased and unbiased data in text format from books, articles and websites. Chat GPT can reproduce the output and stability critical for many sensitive applications and other critical AI systems. However, there may still be errors and biases, and we rely on training data provided in 2021.
        <br><br>
        As humans we are interacting more and more with AI powered machines and Chat GPT is a revolution in AI. It is a powerful model and is particularly advanced due to its deep learning and NLP capabilities. Ultimately, it can generate human responses and is easily understood by users. I thought that wasn't always right.
 
    <br><br>

    <h1 class="sub-title">What is Chat GPT coded in?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Chat GPT is based on the GPT-3 language model developed by OpenAI. The source code for GPT-3 has not been released, but a post on the Stackexchange site suggests that GPT-3 is written with "the same model and architecture as GPT-2". The message continues saying "The GPT-2 source code is 100% Python."
        <br><br>
        Chat GPT itself can be provided if asked to generate Pythos C++ and JavaScript code.</p>

         <h1 class="sub-title">What is a GPT-3 chatbot?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            The GPT-3 chatbot is a bot, an artificial intelligence application that can be programmed to engage in natural human communication. Developing with an engine like OpenAI GPT-3 can provide impressive engagement and usability.
            <br><br>
GPT-3 Chatbot application uses deep learning and other methods to understand language and language patterns. With this, communication is virtually indistinguishable from human conversation, and there are implementations that can be far more useful than regular chatbots, such as for customer service.

         <h1 class="sub-title">Is there Chat GPT for Android?</h1>
     <br>
     <p>There is no official Chat GPT app from Open AI, and no word on whether or not there will be an app. There are "chat GPT apps" available on the Play Store, but they are not from the company.
        <br><br>
        It should be noted that Chat GPT uses the GPT-3 model, which is only available through the OpenAI Chat GPT page. However, OpenAI does not have an Android (or iPhone) app, but you can access Chat GPT from your mobile device by navigating to the same URL.

             <h1 class="sub-title">Is Chat GPT free?</h1>
             <br>
             <p>You may have already heard of Chat GPT. It is an AI-based online chatbot launched by OpenAI at the end of last year. People who want to use this software may have the following questions. Is Chat GPT free? Yes, but see below for details.
                <br><br>
                Chat It's no exaggeration to say that GPT was very popular.
                If you are not afraid of artificial intelligence, we strongly recommend that you give this model a try. GPT chat works by opening a human Q&A style conversation between you and the AI. You can ask him almost anything your heart desires.
                <br><br>
                AI can solve coding problems, write well-structured essays, and, if desired, discuss philosophical issues related to AI itself.

              <img src="images/gpt-2.jpg">
              <br><br><br>
              <p>Yes, Chat GPT is free for commercial use. However, as OpenAI points out, there are some considerations. However, it is important to remember that OpenAI does not provide any guarantees or support for GPT, and users should ensure that the way they use the model does not violate any law or regulation."
                <br><br>
                OpenAI also It is clear that the use of AI-powered technologies may have ethical and legal implications.”
                <br><br>
                Even if you want to access OpenAI models in a commercial sense, they are expensive.
                This can be done using the OpenAI API. Let's break down all the information below when it gets a little more complicated.

            <h1 class="sub-title">What is GPT in Chat GPT?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>GPT in Chat GPT stands for Generative Pre-training Transformer. A type of neural network structure often used for natural language processing tasks such as text generation. In fact, each part of the name can be divided into three parts.
                <br><br>
                Generative, as the name suggests, indicates that the model can generate text. Pre-training, on the other hand, is due to the fact that the model is trained with a huge amount of data.
                The reason is to allow the AI ​​to learn common patterns and characteristics of everyday texts and conversations. This is why bots look like humans when you talk to them.
                <br><br>
                Finally, Transformers. In particular, this applies to the architecture of AI models. Google researchers developed this architecture in 2017 and it has since become very popular in the world of natural language processing.
                This means that Chat GPT can handle both long and short requests, and can even generate variable-length text based on hints you provide.
